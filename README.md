# nxzbot.js

nxzbot is a open source [FREE] discord bot meant for use in community servers.

## Info
I started making this bot to teach myself .js so don't expect this to be some amazing bot right off the bat. I will be doing my best to make this a fully functional bot that is nice and easy to use, but keep in mind this is just a learning stepping stone for me.

## Usage

Download all files off this git, put them into a folder and open index.js in your favorite text editor.
